      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>❌ Coronavirus will go away in Summer months.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Wrong. Previous pandemics didn’t follow weather patterns plus as we
          enter summer, there will be winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Virus
          is global.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>❌ Coronavirus lives in the throat.</strong> So drink lots of
          water so the virus is pushed into the stomach where the acid will kill
          it.<br /><br />
          Virus may gain entry via throat but it penetrates into the host cells.
          You can’t wash it away. Excessive water will make you run to the
          toilet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            ❌ Car accidents kill 30,000 people annually. What’s the big deal
            with COVID-19? </strong
          ><br /><br />Car accident are not contagious, their fatalities don’t
          double every three days, they don’t cause mass panic or a market
          crash.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            ❌ One of the best strategies to prevent COVID-19 is to clean every
            door knob in your home with disinfectants. </strong
          ><br /><br />

          Wrong. Hand washing/maintaining 6ft distance is best practice. Unless
          you’re caring for a COVID patient at home, your home surfaces should
          not be a big risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> ❌ I am young and healthy, it doesn't matter for me. </strong
          ><br /><br />
          Even if you're young and healthy still you increase the risk of your
          death significantly. And also the risk of spreading it to others.

          <strong>✅ It Grows very fast by a factor of 2<sup>x</sup> 📈</strong
          >. <br /><br />
          The COVID-19 virus has a Basic Reporduction Number or R<sub>0</sub> of 2.2 Which means an average person transfers it to 2 others who
          transfer it to 2 others who transfer it to 2 more and thus 2<sup>x</sup>.

        <li>
          <strong>✅ Washing your hands with soap literally kills the virus 🧼</strong
          >. <br /><br />
          The virus is made up of stuff surrounded by fat. Using any regular soap (even non-alcoholic) breaks the fat and the tears the virus apart. <br><br>

          Just be sure to wash your hands properly for 20 seconds so that virus at every corner of your hand is tore apart. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>✅ Avoid Shaking Hands 🤝 </strong
          >. <br /><br />
          Everytime you shake your hand with someone containing the virus in their hand you get the virus in your hands too. <br><br>

          It takes approx. 8 hand shakes before the virus does not transmit further. So if someone shook hands with someone who shook hand with someone who shook hand with someone... you get the idea... 7 times, then you have a probability of getting infected. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>✅ Social Distancing is the key</strong
          >. <br /><br />
 COVID-19 can also transfer by someone coughing/sneezing at you, maintain a good distance with every person, you don't know who shook hand with who, who shook hand with who... not again... just stay away from Humans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>✅ Avoid Animals 🐶</strong
          > <br /><br />
            There have been evidences where pets like dogs can contract COVID-19 and spread it to other humans while not getting infected. Although it is not entirely sure if it is true.
